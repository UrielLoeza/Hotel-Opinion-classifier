This project comprises three notebooks, all of which utilize natural language processing techniques. The first notebook preprocesses the text and generates a CSV file containing the filtered opinions. The n-grams notebook presents a collection of the most common n-grams, which are used to create both positive and negative n-grams, thereby adding a new column to the table used by the models. The third notebook takes this CSV file and, using TF-IDF and n-grams, trains various AI models to predict opinion ratings based on user inputs.
