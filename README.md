This project is part of the "Natural and Language Processing" class. It consists of a Jupyter notebook with Python code, utilizing libraries such as NLTK, SpaCy, and Pandas for preprocessing, analysis, and the construction of three classifiers for hotel ratings. A grid search is employed to determine the optimal parameters for each model, and a confusion matrix is used to evaluate the results. Throughout the project, I applied tasks such as tokenization, data cleaning, and the use of different machine learning models to enhance the classification process.
